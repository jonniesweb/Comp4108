# Computer Systems Security - Comp 4108 Winter 2016

Professor: Dr. Anil Somayaji, Carleton University. [Official course website/wiki](http://homeostasis.scs.carleton.ca/wiki/index.php/Computer_Systems_Security_%28Winter_2016%29)

This course is a ton of fun. Anil does his best to make the class and its content interesting.

## What it's like to be in Comp 4108

In the first half of this course we focused on making "hacking journals": basically performing an attack or setting up a defense and writing about your thought process as you go along.

In the second half of the course we read papers from the USENIX Security '15 conference before each class. In class we would discuss the purpose of the paper, what makes the attack/defense so interesting, and the underlying technology, to name a few. The discussion was very open and encouraged everyone to participate.

In addition to class participation, we were required to write a short reading analysis of five to ten of these academic papers.


## The contents of this repository

I've included each hacking journal and reading analysis in this repository for safekeeping and to share what Computer Systems Security is all about to prospective or current students.

### Notes

*(On a side note, I've nicknamed this class the breakfast club since it's pretty much just like shooting the crap with your friends)*
